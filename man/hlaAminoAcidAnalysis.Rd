\title{Analyze association of HLA Amino-acids with many variate phenotypes (like case/control or quantitative trait)
Take as input:
(1 required) amino-acids :  subjectID haplotype1 freq1  haplotype2 freq2 postprob followed by many columns of amino-acids("," separator between fields)
(2 optional) differents quantitative phenotypes : subjectID traitName1 traitName2 ... traitName(n)
(3 required) Disease information : 0= control 1=case (needed for frequencies and/or type=disease analysis)
(4 required) the 2 first principals components of the PCA
(5 optional) covariable to correct regressions}
\usage{
hlaAminoAcidAnalysis(
  aminoAcidFile,
  phenoPath = NULL,
  statut,
  pcaPath = NULL,
  covarPath = NULL,
  outputFolder,
  outputFile,
  type = "pheno"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aminoAcidFile}{HLA Amino-acids data exactly as the one provided by easy-HLA webtool}

\item{phenoPath}{phenotypes file with different trait names in columns}

\item{statut}{file conaining subject ID and Disease statut}

\item{pcaPath}{pca's result: subjectID, PC1 and PC2}

\item{covarPath}{must contains SubjectID followed by covariables}

\item{outputFolder}{folder where to save the result}

\item{outputFile}{result's filename}

\item{type}{either "disease" for case/control analysis or "pheno" with quantitative phenotype(s)}
}
\value{
Linear Regression result and many plots : QQplot and personnalized manhattan plot
}
